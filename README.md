# ForestHacks-Hackathon

SignifyAI is a tech-based solution designed to enhance the accessibility of education for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. By leveraging Python and key libraries such as OpenCV, MediaPipe, Scikit-learn, and Pyttsx3, this project aims to translate sign language gestures into text and speech in real-time, making communication seamless and inclusive in educational settings.

This project was created as part of the Forest Hacks Hackathon.
