# ForestHacks-Hackathon

SignifyAI is a tech-based solution developed during the ForestHacks Hackathon to enhance accessibility in education for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. This project utilizes Python, along with libraries like OpenCV, MediaPipe, Scikit-learn, and Pyttsx3, to translate sign language gestures into real-time text and speech. Our goal is to create a seamless and inclusive communication experience within educational settings.
